\usage{
constant_covariance(x1, y1, x2, y2, nugget)
}
\description{
 In this function, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the coordinates of two points for which we want to calculate the covariance, and nugget
	 is the covariance value for identical points.
Note that this is a very basic example of a covariance function, and it assumes no spatial dependence between data points. More complex
	covariance functions are typically used in spatial data analysis to model spatial dependence between data points.
